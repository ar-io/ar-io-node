# OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration
# This collector implements tail-based sampling to reduce telemetry costs
# while maintaining complete visibility into errors and performance issues.

  # Tail sampling - makes sampling decisions after traces complete
  # This allows us to see the full trace before deciding to keep/drop it
  tail_sampling:
    # Wait 10 seconds after trace starts before making decision
    # This ensures the entire trace has been collected

    num_traces: 100000

    # Expected new traces per second (helps with memory management)
