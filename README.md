# AR.IO Gateway Node

## Dev Workflow

### Install dependencies

`yarn install`

### Initialize the SQLite DB

`yarn db:migrate up`

### Run tests

`yarn test`

### Run the service

With defaults:

`yarn start`

Starting at an arbitrary block (only works immediately after initial DB
migration):

`START_HEIGHT=800000 yarn start`

## Docker

### Standalone AR.IO Node

You can run the ar.io gateway as a standalone docker container:

```shell
docker build . -t ar-io-core:latest
docker run -p 4000:4000 -v ar-io-data:/app/data ar-io-core:latest
```

To run with a specified start height (sets height on first run only):

```shell
docker run -e START_HEIGHT=800000 -v $PWD/data/:/app/data ar-io-core:latest
```

### Envoy & AR.IO Node

You can also run [Envoy] along side an `ar.io` node via [Docker Compose]. Envoy
will proxy routes to `arweave.net` not yet implemented in the ar.io node.

```shell
docker compose up --build
```

or:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

Once running, requests can be directed to Envoy server at `localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

When running via docker-compose, it will read a `.env` file in the project root
directory and use the envrionment variables set there.

### GraphQL Pass-Through

Add the following to your `.env` file to proxy GraphQL to another server while
using the ar.io gateway to serve data (using arweave.net GraphQL as an example):

```
GRAPHQL_HOST=arweave.net
GRAPHQL_PORT=443
```

### Unbundling

The ar.io gateway supports unbundling and indexing [ANS-104] bundle data. To
enable this add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```
ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER="<filter string>"
AND104_DATA_INDEX_FILTER="<filter string>"
```

`ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER` determines which TXs and data items (in the case of
nested bundlse) are unbundled, and `AND104_DATA_INDEX_FILTER` determines which
data items within a bundle have their data indexed.

The following types of filters are supported:

```
{ never: true } # the default
{ always: true }
{ attributes: { owner: <owner key>, ... }}
{ tags: [{ name: <utf8 tag name>, value: <utf8 tag value> }, ...]}
{ and: [ <nested filter>, ... ]}
{ or: [ <nested filter>, ... ]}

```

Note: currently only data item data (IDs, hashes, offsets, and sizes) is
indexed. This enables retrieval of data items from L1 transaction data without
delegating to another gateway, but it does not yet enable GraphQL. GraphQL
support will be added a in a future update.

### ArNS

Add the following to your `.env` file to enable ArNS resolution:

```
ARNS_ROOT_HOST=<gateway-hostname>
```

For example if your gateway's hostname was `my-gateway.net` your `.env` would
contain the following:

```
ARNS_ROOT_HOST=my-gateway.net
```

This would allow you to resolve names like `my-arns-name.my-gateway.net` provided
you correctly configured a wildcard DNS entry for your gateway.

Note: ArNS data ID resolution is currently delegated to `arweave.dev`. Routing is
handled locally, but ArNS state is not yet computed locally. Local ArNS state
computation will be added in a future release. Also, be aware, ArNS is still using
a test contract. Resolved names should be considered temporary.

### Wallet assocation

In order to participate in the [ar.io network](https://ar.io/), gateways need to
association themselves with a wallet. This can be configured by setting the AR_IO_WALLET
environment variable. Once set, the associated wallet address is visible via the
`/ar-io/info` endpoint.

### Admin API key

HTTP endpoints under '/ar-io/admin' are protected by an admin API key. On startup,
the admin key is read from the `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable. If no key is
set, a random key is generated and logged. To make a request to an admin endpoint
add an `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_KEY>` header to your request.

## Principles and Practices

### Architecture

- Code to interfaces.
- Separate IO from application logic.
- Make processes [idempotent] whenever possible.
- Separate mutable from immutable data.
- Avoid trusting data when the cost to validate it is low.

### Development and Testing

- To support rapid development iteration, All system components _must_ be
  runnable in a single process.
- Keep the [compile test suite] blazingly fast.
- In general, prefer in-memory implementations over mocks and stubs.
- In general, prefer [sociable over solitary tests].
- Commit messages should describe both what is being changed and why it is
  being changed.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Make liberal use of [Prometheus metrics] to aid in monitoring and debugging.
- Follow the Prometheus [metrics naming recommendations].
